Carried out classification algorithms to predict the occurrence of rain in Australia. The algorithms explored are:
1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM

The model evaluation step is done using:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Scor2
